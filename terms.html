            <h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
              the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of
              Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
            <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            <h3><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong></h3>
            <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those
              Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
              <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
                JURY TRIAL.</strong> The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
              Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary
              Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA
              website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by
              the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be
              conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
              decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
              arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
              Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take
              place in Sussex County, Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court
              to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
              judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If for any reason, Dispute proceeds in court rather than
              arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in New
              York County, New York, and the Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal
              jurisdiction, and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
              courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
              the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use. In no event
              shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1)
              year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
              neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
              be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within
              the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
              that court.</p>
            <h3><strong>Restrictions</strong></h3>
            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
              To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
              there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
              class action procedures, and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
              purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons</p>
            <h3><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></h3>
            <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding
              arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
              intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
              theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
              provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
              falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall
              be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
              Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that the Site is not your broker, intermediary, agent, or advisor and has no fiduciary
              obligation to You. The site explicitly does not (1) give users any personal financial advice, nor does it

              contain investment advice. Materials are provided solely as an informational resource to help You make
              your own decisions at Your sole risk. The instructions You enter to affect Your trades using the Site will
              be executed using the application programming interface key (&ldquo;API Key&rdquo;) of Your exchange
              accounts that you share with Us. You hereby grant Us permission to place orders and trade on Your behalf
              on the exchange using your API Key. We do not guarantee execution via the API Key and do not warrant the
              protection or security of the API Key. We shall not be liable for any losses incurred by You in the event
              an API Key is lost, stolen, misused or malfunctions. We only collect an API Key from You for the purpose
              of placing orders in accordance with Your strategies and instructions. In the event You provide an API Key
              with withdrawal permissions enabled, which may cause, upon placing an order, any withdrawal from Your
              account, We shall not be held liable under any circumstances. No representation or implication is being
              made that using the Site will guarantee profits or ensure freedom from losses. Simulated performance
              results have inherent limitations and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy or sell any

              evaluate trading information and your use of that information is entirely at your own risk. Trading
              digital assets is volatile and You may lose a significant portion, or all, of your investment. As such, we

              investment professional before using the Site. In addition to risks associated with Site use in the
              &ldquo;Modifications and Interruptions&rdquo; section above, factors outside Our control may also result
              in loss of digital assets, a decrease in or loss of all value for the assets, inability to access assets,
              inability to trade assets, inability to receive financial benefits which are available to other asset

              any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
              These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our

              provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
              part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and
              enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
              relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree
              that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby
              waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of
